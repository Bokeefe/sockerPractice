This is a voting app that lets users enter into a vote together and see the results live using socket.io.
The options are for simple Yea,Nay, or Abstain voting. Users only get one vote and the results are updated.

One can simulate multiple users by opening several browsers and jumping on the same vote together.  Currently, there are too many votes emitted when there are multiple users.
